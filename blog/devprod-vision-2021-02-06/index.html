<p>This is the first in a series of posts that will explain the strategic goals of
the Clouddot DevProd team, their key responsiblities, and how those
responsibilities fit into their strategic goals.  This post will focus on the
rationale behind the creation of Clowder.</p>
<h2 id="strategic-goals">Strategic Goals<a class="anchor" href="#strategic-goals">#</a></h2>
<p>The DevProd team&rsquo;s chief concern is to improve developer productivity by
focusing on two strategic goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience</strong>:  Improving developers' experience of operating inside a
kubernetes-based platform such as Clouddot, e.g. debugging, maintaining
deployment resources, observability, logging.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>:  Investigating and documenting best practices and
procedures that ensure consistent DevOps behaviours.  Also includes
<em>automating</em> as much of these best practices as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>These goals are closely related but are worth calling out separately.
Scalability <em>could</em> roll up under developer experience: a more scalable
organization implies that it takes less effort to get the same amount of work
done, which would be consdiered a better experience.  But it&rsquo;s worth calling
out scalability because it&rsquo;s such a key strategy to achieving a better
developer experience, particularly as the Clouddot platform continues to
rapidly grow.</p>
<p>Also, scalability is just decsribing productivity from a solution-based
perspective: a solution is considered scalable if it makes the individuals in
the organization more productive (which leads to a better overall experience).</p>
<p>Lastly, developers' productivity is of course a measurement of <em>time</em>.  How
long does it take for a developer to e.g. onboard a new app onto the Clouddot
platform, push a changeset to production, or integrate Redis into their
app?  What Clowder automates saves signifcant time for both developers and SRE.</p>
<p>There is a lot of room to improve Clouddot&rsquo;s experience and scalability, and
Clowder is a key component in moving that experience forward.</p>
<h2 id="todays-complex-environments">Today&rsquo;s Complex Environments<a class="anchor" href="#todays-complex-environments">#</a></h2>
<p>It is well known that the complexity and configurability of today’s
environments can require many hours of research and experimentation in order to
achieve a minimum viable deployment. From the deceptively simple task of
building a lightweight, secure, and robust image to the more advanced stages
of operations, such as pod scaling and monitoring, the knowledge required to
excel in this landscape is vast.</p>
<p>Teams often have little time for researching solutions to a particular
operational problem — and rightly so. A team should be focused on the
development and stabilization of features for their application in order to
provide business value as quickly as possible. What often transpires as a
result of having no pre-set standard and a tight application-centric focus is a
number of different, sometimes divergent, solutions to the same problem. This
can make it very difficult to achieve a consistent standard in operations
across the platform.  This consistency is key to building a scalable platform:
they are more automatable, understandable, and more easily documented.</p>
<p>As an example, take the simple case of documentation tooling. It could be
expected that combining documentation from multiple projects into a single
place with a consistent look and feel would be rather straightforward to
achieve. Yet the variety of tooling utilized across the ecosystem has resulted
in a non-trivial effort, consisting of converters and other scripts to try to
reach a singular portal for documentation.</p>
<h2 id="curated-toolchains-for-everyone">Curated Toolchains for Everyone<a class="anchor" href="#curated-toolchains-for-everyone">#</a></h2>
<p>The DevProd team works to curate the set of tools for developing and operating
applications on the Clouddot platform.  Because they operate as a team outside
of any one application, the DevProd team can take a wider view of the
requirements and offer solutions that will provide the biggest net benefit to
the entire platform.</p>
<p>The end result may not necessarily be the most optimal solution for each
individual team, but keeping an approach consistent across the platform at the
cost of e.g. a 5% performance is usually worth the added scalability.</p>
<h2 id="codifying-the-operational-logic">Codifying the Operational Logic<a class="anchor" href="#codifying-the-operational-logic">#</a></h2>
<p>Whilst these best practices and tools can be provided to developers as
documents and scripts, the onus is then once again on the developers to
understand and adopt them. This consumes already precious resources and is open
to errors resulting from mistakes during input (pebkac), misinterpretations of
specifications, and intentional or unintentional non-compliance.</p>
<p>The DevProd team chose to minimise this risk with Clowder. By codifying these
practices into an operator and promoting convention over configuration, Clowder
can automatically configure applications to align with best practices and
standards, while at the same time reducing the developer knowledge necessary to
maintain an optimal environment.</p>
<h2 id="operational-benefits">Operational Benefits<a class="anchor" href="#operational-benefits">#</a></h2>
<p>The scalability benefits Clowder brings also extend to the front line support
teams (i.e.  SRE) dealing with operations. These teams traditionally spend a
portion of their time orienting themselves to each app they are responsible
for. This process is time consuming and leaves room for human error,
potentiallly leading to incorrect assumptions being made about application
configuration or process flow.</p>
<p>With the responsibility of building and deploying Kubernetes resources
delegated to Clowder, certain variables that were previously left up to
personal preference, for example service port numbers, can be assumed for every
single application, eliminating costly ambiguity when operations teams are
trying to understand an application’s entrypoints.</p>
<p>Clowder gives operations teams (and other interested devs) a single point of
entry to understand an application, with all relevant information contained in
a single document (the <code>ClowdApp</code>).  Knowledge gained understanding one app
is often transferable to another, decreasing problem investigation time, and
increasing platform operational awareness.</p>
<p>As both operations and developers gain an understanding of Clowder and the
deployment models used, there is also a shared language they can use to
describe an app&rsquo;s operation, fostering tighter cohesion between the two.</p>
<h2 id="insulation-from-environmental-and-requirement-changes">Insulation from Environmental and Requirement Changes<a class="anchor" href="#insulation-from-environmental-and-requirement-changes">#</a></h2>
<p>By reducing developers’ interactions with environments to a single
configuration document and letting Clowder deploy and configure their
applications and prerequisite services, developers are automatically insulated
from the changes that occur in ever evolving operational environments. These
changes will instead be implemented inside Clowder and automatically applied at
the correct time.</p>
<p>As an example, the arduous task of complying with FedRAMP specifications could
well be reduced by say 30% by having an application be managed by Clowder.
Since Clowder can ensure that certain requirements of FedRAMP are implicitly
met, developer teams are left with a reduced workload. As and when these
requirements are reviewed and updated, Clowder can be modified to reflect those
changes, insulating the development teams from any further effort.</p>
<p>Devs also benefit from configuring their apps using a single JSON document
mounted in their app&rsquo;s container.  Devs can depend on this document being
consistent regardless of the operational variables outside the application,
e.g. using an RDS database versus a local DB or using Redis versus Elasticash.
(Side note: files mounted into a container is a more secure way to provide
sensitive information to apps than environment variables since they are so
often dumped to logs.)</p>
<p>As the number of these changes continues to grow, with the advent of
requirements like service meshes, advanced autoscaling configurations, and
canary deployments, developers onboarding to Clowder will be able to reduce
time spent on researching operational resources and instead spend more time
delivering business value by leveraging the reasonable default configurations
that Clowder provides.</p>
